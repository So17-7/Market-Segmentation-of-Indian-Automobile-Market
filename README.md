# Market-Segmentation-of-Indian-Automobile-Market

## Description
This project applies **K-Means Clustering** to segment customers based on their **automobile buying behavior**. The goal is to group customers into 5 distinct segments based on patterns and similarities in their purchasing behavior, preferences, and demographics. By identifying these segments, businesses can optimize marketing strategies, improve product targeting, and enhance customer experience.

The dataset contains various features such as customer income, age, purchasing history, and more, which are used to identify meaningful segments.

## Techniques Used
- **K-Means Clustering**: This unsupervised learning algorithm is used to divide the customer base into 5 distinct segments based on their buying behavior.
- **Feature Selection**: The dataset is preprocessed by selecting relevant features (such as income, age, and car preferences) for clustering.
